<p align="center">I'm a master's student in computer science, curious and with a constant desire to learn. Since my undergraduate studies, I have been fascinated by exploring data, mainly through interactive visualizations. I have recently joined an Erasmus Mundus master program (EDISS), which focuses on developing software systems that integrate data science and machine learning solutions. However, in my journey, I also had the opportunity to work as a mobile developer, mainly iOS.</p>
